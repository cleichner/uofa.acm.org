<h4>Go and more <em>(Justin Van Horne)</em></h4>
<p>Our first lightning talk of the semester kicks off with an introduction to Go. Go is concurrent, garbage-collected, and scalable language. It provides a fast, fun, and interesting design that allows for interfaces, reflection, concurrency and more. With that said we are setting up a talk line-up, so talks, times, and dates are subject to change.</p>
