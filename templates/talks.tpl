<h4>Hang-out / ICPC Mix</h4>
<p>Show up and hang-out. Talk about the <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/'>HN-flavor</a> of the day, your favorite subreddit, or just vent your weekly-CS irritations. You're welcome to continue the discussion afterwards while enjoying a few drinks. <span class='red'>Aftermath:</span> We ended up solving two problems from the <a href='http://www.cs.arizona.edu/acm/LocalContest/Problems08.pdf'>2011 competition</a>, enjoyed a discussion on embedding Python, a primer on core concepts in the ACM competition, and a look at other competitions outside of ICPC. The night ended with drinks and food at a local bar.</p>
